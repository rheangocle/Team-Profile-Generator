## Summary

Node js and Inquirer were used to create a command prompt that asks questions about their team and generate a page containing employee information. When the user starts the command line, they will be prompted to add a manager for the team. After they complete the prompt for the manager, they will asked to added another team member (engineer, intern). Once the user finishes adding all the team members, the application will generate an html file with simple employee information on the page. The user will be able to open the github profiles on a separate page or click on the email address and the default email program will open up.
